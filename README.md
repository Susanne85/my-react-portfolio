## Description

This is an applicaion utilising REACT to display applications that I have written.  There are several pages; AboutMe, Contact, Portfolio and Resume.
The AboutMe page which is defaulted when the application is opened is a short introduction of myself.  The Contact Page allows the user to send an email, although at this stage I am only displaying an alert on the contact information that the user has entered.  The Portfolio page displays six applications that I have developed or as part of a team helped to develop, which includes links to executing the applications as well as links to the appropriate GITHUB repositories.  The Resume page outlines my Front End and Back End proficiencies as well as the abilty to download my resume.
